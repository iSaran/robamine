Here you can find the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) for all the releases. We use
the [Semantic Versioning Specifications](http://semver.org/) for release
numbering.

The documentation for the latest release can be found
[here](https://auth-arl.github.io/docs/rlrl/latest/index.html). For the
latest master you need to produce it locally with `doxygen Doxyfile` inside the
repository. Then see `docs/html/index.html`.
